# kryptos-investigation

This repository acts as a collection of tools to investigate the [Jim Sanborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Sanborn)'s sculpture [Kryptos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos) located at the CIA headquaters in Langley, Virginia.

Kryptos consists of four large copper plates. These plates consist of both [ciphertext](kryptos/ciphertext/ciphertext.txt) and a [vigenere table](kryptos/table/vigenere-tableau.txt).

Currently, the ciphertext of Kryptos is believed to consist of four passages: [K1](kryptos/ciphertext/k1.txt), [K2](kryptos/ciphertext/k2.txt), [K3](kryptos/ciphertext/k3.txt), and [K4](kryptos/ciphertext/k4.txt). To public knowledge, K4 remains the only passage which has not been fully decrypted.
